This project aims to reduce the spaces of your videos and audios encoding it on `hevc`.

## Why video-diet?
The answer is easy. I have a lot old-movies/videos and music/audios taking a lot of space in the hard-drive.
So I'm always short on disk space, the by accident discover de `hevc` codec. when i need to shrink a video of `3GB`
to upload it to `Telegram`, the convertion take my 3GB movie and returned a 300 MB with the same quality ðŸ˜±. So I
decided that I would convert all my video and audio files , but they are a lot, so I build this tool for it.

More info about `hevc`:

## Installation

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install video-diet
```

</div>

## FFMPEG

In order to run the project you must install `ffmpeg`.

### For Linux
In any linux machine you can get it from your favorite package manager.

For arch:
```console
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

For Debian/Ubuntu:
```console
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## For Windows

Download a windows ffmpeg build here https://ffmpeg.org/download.html. Unzip it and change the folder name to `FFmpeg`. Copy the folder into `C:\` and then add the path `C:\FFmpeg\bin` to the enviroment variables of the system. 

To check correct instalation open a new instance of cmd and type:
```console
ffmpeg --version`.
```

## Example

### For a file

```bash
video-diet file test.mp4
```
This option conserve the original file

### For a folder
```bash
video-diet folder ~/Videos
```
This option replaces the original file for the converted files

#### Ignoring files on the folder
```bash
video-diet folder ~/Videos --ignore-extension .mp4
```
This option ignores all the .mp4 files on ~/Videos

```bash
video-diet folder ~/Videos --ignore-path ~/Videos/subfolder
```
This option ignores all the files on ~/Videos/subfolder

## AV1 Support

To use AV1 instead of hevc add --codec av1 to the commnads above and that will use libaom-av1 instad of libx265 to encode the files 

## Note

The video conversion can take some time. Depending on the original video properties; the conversion time can be longer than the video.

## For developers

### You must first install *poetry*

Poetry provides a custom installer that will install `poetry` isolated from the rest of your system by vendorizing its dependencies. This is the recommended way of installing `poetry`.

**osx / linux / bashonwindows install instructions**

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`

**windows powershell install instructions**

`(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python`

The installer installs the `poetry` tool to Poetry's `bin` directory. On Unix it is located at `$HOME/.poetry/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.poetry\bin`.

This directory will be in your `$PATH` environment variable, which means you can run them from the shell without further configuration.

### Then you need to configure the environment

Inside the project make `poetry install` and after `poetry shell` for start the virtualenv.

For testing the code run `video-diet`.

Good luck ðŸ˜‰.
